WorldWideWeb
============

This is the first web browser, originally written by Tim Berners-Lee.
For further details, refer to this [wikipedia article](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb.html)
or the [original website](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb.html)

The original source was obtained from [this site](http://browsers.evolt.org/browsers/archive/worldwideweb/NeXT).

Notes
-----

I have no idea how to make this compile or run. This repository was created
as a means of archiving a piece of history. The original software was written
on a NextStep computer, using NextStep specific APIs. (And no, they are not
compatible with Cocoa. I checked.)

It may be possible to build and run this on a NextStep emulator such as
[Previous](http://previous.alternative-system.com), but I don't know if anyone
has tried and succeeded.

If you ever do get this to run, please let me know!

Original Readme

    IMPORTANT: Get and read the files COPYRIGHT and CERN before downloading 
    other files.
 
    This directory contains binaries for the NeXTSTEP Web browser
    application.

    	THE EDITOR

    WorldWideWeb_0.16.tar.Z is the only wysiwyg hypertext editor for the
    NeXT.  It has limitations and bugs -- it can't access Gopher, FTP sites,
    etc.  But it is a hypertext editor!

    Note this app is compiled for NextStep 3.0 and won't work with 2.1.
    There is no way round this; don't ask!  (The Project file is
    converted by the ProjectBuilder to a version 3 project file
    when you first compile for version 3.  The version 3 project
    file won't work with 2.0 (Interface builder and project builder
    shared a file and an app in 2.x), and so there is no going back!
    The 3.x app won't work under 2.x as it needs 3.x shared libaries.)


    	THE BROWSER

    The file labelled 1.0 is a pre-alpha browser which uses the libwww
    library, so you can get multimedia files etc etc.  Does doc
    format conversion, etc.  

    THE EDITOR DOES NOT WORK.  NOT SUPPORTED....
    It can't edit -- try and it will destroy your files!
    Only for the curious.  This DOES handle Gopher, FTP, etc.

    Sorry they have the same icon now ... can be very confusing
    if you use both.
